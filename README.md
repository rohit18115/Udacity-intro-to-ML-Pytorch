## Installation

This project requires **Python 3.6.0** and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


<a name="run"/>

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `intro-to-machine-learning-with-pytorch/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook <your_archive>.ipynb
```
on any Jupyter Notebook.
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Each project will be committed in the `projects/` folder.
