In this challenge, you'll be given the following sample dataset (as in data.csv), and your goal is to write a function that executes mini-batch gradient descent to find a best-fitting regression line. You might consider looking into numpy's matmul function for this!

Example dataset with points between -3 and 2 on the x-axis and 0.0 and 3.5 on the y-axis.
