# **Programming Quiz: Multiple Linear Regression**

In this quiz, you'll be using the [Boston house-prices dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). The dataset consists of 13 features of 506 houses and the median home value in $1000's. You'll fit a model on the 13 features to predict the value of the houses.

You'll need to complete each of the following steps:

**1. Build a linear regression model**

- Create a regression model using scikit-learn's `[LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)` and assign it to `model`.
- Fit the model to the data.

**2. Predict using the model**

- Predict the value of `sample_house`.
